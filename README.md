# There is a need to implement the next features:

* container on the page, that accept draggable files
* multi-upload
* the page should not refresh
* by dragging the file on the page the dragging container should change the style to indicate user where is need to drop files
by leaving page borders
* accept only specified file types: “jpg”, “jpeg”, “png”, “gif”, “pdf”
* for uploaded files show the preview list - small thumbnails
* a solution should be cross-platform and works at the browsers: “chrome”, “safari”, “firefox”, “edge” with the latest updates.

For the front-end, it needs to use the pure javascript without any frameworks, libraries or the other additions.

For the back-end, there is can be created node.js server.
